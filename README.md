# Lexycon
Lexycon is a command-line tool that will revolutionise the way you search. Made with Python 3.5, Lexycon will search for a
pattern and show you where the search pattern exists, along with extended line context - neighbouring words around the match.

## How do I use Lexycon?

To search a file, place it in the same directory as pygrep.py, browse there and run,
```
python pygrep.py filename.txt
```
pygrep.py will search only one file at a time
